- When troubleshooting systems and encountering unfamiliar acronyms in logs, config files, kernel messages, or command outputs.
- When writing scripts, documentation, or reports that reference low-level system components or protocols.
- And for when trying to tranfer into another job such as DevOps, sysadmin, or networking role. Thus giving you the need for a high-level understanding of terms across domains.
